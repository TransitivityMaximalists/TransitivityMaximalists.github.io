<h1><span class="s2"><b>The Workshop on Decentralized Credit Networks (DCN)</b></span></h1>
<h3 ><span class="s2">In Association with Advances in Financial Technologies - AFT 2023</span></h3>
<h4><span class="s2">October 26, 2023<br />
Princeton University, NJ, USA</span></h4>

<p ><span class="s2">Credit networks are important financial constructs with applications spanning from clearing transactions between central banks to fostering informal credit exchanges among individuals and small businesses. These networks allow transitive transactions, where local trust can be leveraged to power expansive interactions that traverse the entire network diameter. Distinguished from the surge of cryptocurrencies, credit networks offer a unique proposition by enabling seamless transactions across conventional fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, and user-defined currencies, all facilitated through IOU credit paths.</span></p>

<p ><span class="s2">In the pursuit of decentralization, recent technical advances bring some new potential and viewpoints: blockchains and smart contracts provide the infrastructure to track credit, utilization, and digital asset interactions. Complementary advancements in routing strategies and channel maintenance, initially developed for other contexts as Bitcoin's lightening network, are finding new purpose in the realm of credit networks. Additionally, the incorporation of privacy-enhancing technologies such as Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs, Multiparty computation, and Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) holds the potential to imbue credit networks with an unprecedented level of privacy.</span></p>

<p ><span class="s2">
This workshop aims at bringing academic and industrial participants together to discuss structures, security, and privacy for credit networks
and foster future collaborations towards more inclusive and secure decentralized credit networks. Our goal is to offer a platform to discuss the structural intricacies, security against Sybil attacks and node compromises, and privacy enhancements within credit networks.</span></p>

<h3><span class="s2"><b>Organizers</b></span></h3>

<p ><span class="s2">

</span></p>


<h3><span class="s2"><b>Workshop Format</b></span></h3>
<p ><span class="s2">The workshop will consist of a few invited talks from the academia and the industry, a panel, and contributed short talks.
</span></p>

<h4><span class="s2">Invited Talks</span></h4>
<p ><span class="s2">A list of industrial and academic speaker on different aspects of IOU credit networks will be included soon.
</span></p>

<h4><span class="s2">A Panel</span></h4>

The panel will focus on the key challenges with (decentralized ) credit networks as we start to consider them for applications beyond traditional clearing houses.

<h4><span class="s2">Contributed Talks</span></h4>
<p ><span class="s2">We solicit submissions of talk abstracts on topics related to decentralized credit networks, including but not limited to:</span></p>
<ul >
  <li ><span class="s2">Mathematical models of credit network dynamics and liquidity</span></li>
  <li ><span class="s2">Distributed algorithms for credit networks</span></li>
  <li ><span class="s2">Resistance to Sybil/compromised credit network nodes </span></li>
  <li "><span class="s2">Credit Network privacy</span></li>
  <li ><span class="s2">Credit network applications beyond financial systems</span></li>
</ul>
<p ><span class="s2">For contributed talks, submissions should be extended abstracts (maximum 2 pages) in a format of the authorâ€™s choosing. Please send you submissions to the organizers by email on or before September 22nd. Early submission are welcome and the organizing team will review submission on an ongoing basis. We hope to finalize the program at the end of September. There will not be any workshop proceedings.</span></p>


<h3><span class="s2"><b>Registration</b></span></h3>

<p ><span class="s2">
Thanks for generous industry support, the workshop will be FREE for the first 20/30/50 participants. While the AFT registration system will request the attendees to pay $100/50 to register for the workshop. The workshop organizers will reimburse the amount for the first 20/30/50 registrations.</span></p>

<p ><span class="s2">
While the workshop will be free. It is important to register as we may not be able to accommodate onsite registrations due to the venue restrictions.</span></p>
